# Markdown Documentation

House rules for Markdown that renders well on GitHub and passes markdownlint.
Syntax details live in the references; load one only when the task needs it.

## Reference Guides

| Topic | File | Load When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Alerts and callouts | [alerts-and-callouts.md](references/alerts-and-callouts.md) | Note, tip, important, warning, caution blocks |
| Collapsible sections, highlighting, badges | [collapsible-sections.md](references/collapsible-sections.md) | `<details>`/`<summary>`, syntax highlighting, badges |
| Extended GFM syntax | [extended-syntax-github-flavored-markdown.md](references/extended-syntax-github-flavored-markdown.md) | Footnotes, task lists, autolinks, emoji |
| Links, images, code blocks, tables | [links-and-images.md](references/links-and-images.md) | Link and image syntax, fenced code, table syntax |
| Lists | [lists.md](references/lists.md) | Ordered, unordered, nested and task lists |
| New document skeleton | [doc-template.md](templates/doc-template.md) | Writing a new README or doc page from scratch; keep only the sections it needs |
| Text formatting | [text-formatting.md](references/text-formatting.md) | Bold, italic, strikethrough, emphasis |

## Line Length and Wrapping

- Fill prose to 80 columns: wrap each paragraph so lines run as close to 80
  characters as they can, not one sentence per line.
- After an edit to a paragraph, re-fill only that paragraph; leave untouched
  paragraphs alone so the diff stays small.
- Tables are exempt from the limit, and table rows stay on one line. A literal
  path, URL or identifier that cannot be split may run past 80 columns on a line
  of its own, in code blocks as well; other code block lines are not exempt.

## Linting

Run `markdownlint-cli2 <files>` from the repository root on every changed
Markdown file, including agent instruction files (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
`SKILL.md`), so that `.markdownlint.yaml` applies, and fix what it reports.

## Code Blocks

- Fence code with backticks, never with tildes or by four-space indentation.
  A fence inside a list item is indented with the item.
- Give every fenced block a language. Use `text` for plain output or
  pseudocode.
- Pick the language that matches the content (`bash`, `python`, `rust`,
  `toml`, `yaml`, `json`, `sql`, `markdown`), because syntax highlighting
  depends on it.

## Tables

- Surround tables with blank lines, and give every row the same number of
  cells.
- Use leading and trailing pipes, and the simple `| --- |` separator rather
  than padded columns.

## General Rules

- ATX headings (`#`), with blank lines around headings, lists, code blocks and
  tables.
- One H1 per document, as its first heading; CLAUDE.md, which only imports
  AGENTS.md, has none.
- Heading levels go down one at a time, and a heading does not end with `.`,
  `,`, `;`, `:`, `!` or `?`.
- Title Case for headings: capitalize every word except articles,
  coordinating conjunctions and prepositions of up to four letters (`a`,
  `the`, `and`, `or`, `of`, `to`, `in`, `with`) that are not first or last.
  Short verbs and pronouns are capitalized (`Is`, `That`), and so is each
  part of a hyphenated word (`Repository-Wide`). Names and code keep their
  own spelling, as in `# base-install`.
- No trailing whitespace except two spaces for a hard line break, no consecutive
  blank lines and a single newline at the end of the file.
- Inline HTML only for `<div>`, `<img>`, `<details>` and `<summary>`; write
  everything else in Markdown.
- Dashes (`-`) for bullets, numbers counting up (`1.`, `2.`, `3.`) for ordered
  lists, `---` for horizontal rules and asterisks for emphasis (`*italic*`,
  `**bold**`).

## Links, Images and Accessibility

- Use descriptive link text, not "click here".
- Use relative links for files inside the repository.
- Write a URL as a link or in angle brackets (`<https://…>`), never bare.
- Give every image alt text, and do not put text content in images.
